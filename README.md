| Solution Code | Sample solutions for all required sections | Here |

## Project Objective

We've provided a Jupyter notebook that contains the kinds of coding challenges that often come up in data science job interviews. In addition to preparing you for interviews, completing challenges like these is a fun way to develop your Python skills.

Some of these problems are well known, so it may be possible to find complete solutions online. Students should see these questions as an opportunity to challenge themselves; looking up answers limits the potential growth that comes from practice and repetition of these skills.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Optional**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **bonus** sections for some additional challenges!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

- First, make sure you have cloned the whole `course-materials` repo on your local directory of choice (**you only have to do this once!!!**). For example, if you want to clone the folder in your `Documents` folder, just do it like this:
```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/sg-dat-15/course-materials.git
# Type your username and password if prompted
```

- Copy out the files in `project-1-code-challenge` (inside `~/Documents/course-materials`) to a new folder (in `~/Documents`):
```bash
cp -r course-materials/project-1-code-challenge .
```

- Open jupyter notebook by running the following command on a new terminal (or `Anaconda Prompt` for Windows user)"
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

- Then in your jupyter notebook web browser, navigate to `Documents/project-1-code-challenge`, and click on `project-code-challenge.ipynb` to open it. Then try to answer the questions as per instructions above

- Once you are satisfied with the answers, run the following to stage the files
```bash
git add README.md project-code-challenge.ipynb
```

- Then run the following to commit the files:
```bash
git commit -m "Any useful commit message"
```

- For submission, create a `new` repository on either the General Assembly [Github Enterprise](https://git.generalassemb.ly) or Public [Github](https://github.com/). Name the repository the same name as this folder: `project-1-code-challenge` (**you only have to do this once!!!**)

- After you have created the repository, copy the 2 lines of `git remote add` and `git push`, and run them in your terminal (make sure you `cd ~/Documents/project-1-code-challenge` first before running them)
